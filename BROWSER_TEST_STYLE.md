# Browser Tests HOWTOs and Best Practices

This document contains guidelines for writing browser tests in Embeddable Framework.

All the browser tests are located in the e2e folder. Jest is the test runner,
and Puppeteer is used for browser automation.

## Best Practices

#### Use visual selectors when possible

Prefer to use selectors that refer to visual cues, rather than things that only a computer/developer can interpret. Ideally we should be able to read e2e tests and understand what the behaviour would look like if it was us using the widget in a browser. In order of preference try and use:

- Common helper functions in /e2e/helpers
- Visual helper functions provided by testing libraries (getByLabelText to query for labels, getByPlaceholderText to query for placeholders, etc)
- For elements with no functional selectors, use test ids

#### Do not include assertions in setup code

`beforeEach` and setup code should not contain assertions.

#### Keep tests focused

Try to keep tests concise and try not to include too many test assertions throughout your whole test. Use the `waitFor*` helpers, `click*` helpers and enter text helpers etc to walk through your setup and then test your main assertion at the end of your test. Your main assertion should match your test description.

#### Wait only when needed

The test framework includes built-in helpers that can automatically wait for elements
to appear or disappear from a page. Use `wait` only when necessary, such as if there's
a network request involved or if there's a particularly long animation or an
artificial delay.

#### Watch out for shared state

Be wary of global states like localStorage and cookies, especially if they can affect other tests. A common case is chat, as starting a chat in one test can cause the widget to load the chatting screen in another test

If a newly added test passes, but other tests in the suite suddenly start failing, consider
whether share state could be the cause.

#### Use waitFor\* helpers

To avoid flakiness, use the `waitFor*` helpers to make sure the widget is ready before performing an action. For example, if you want to do a help center search, make sure youâ€™re in the help center embed by checking the title or the existence of the search field, before making a search.

#### Test APIs in prerender as well

When testing APIs, test that they work in prerender as well, especially if the API being tested would most likely be used in prerender. Use the provided `evaluateBeforeSnippetLoads` and
`evaluateAfterSnippetLoads` helpers to inject prerender scripts.

#### Explicit setup function instead of beforeEach

Similar to [integration and unit tests](TEST_STYLE.md#explicit-setup-function-instead-of-beforeeach), use explicit setup functions instead of `beforeEach`.

## HOWTOs

#### Running the tests

There are two test suites in the e2e folder: normal browser tests and visual regression tests.
They are run separately.

##### Running browser tests

For browser tests, run `npm run e2e` to run the browser test suite. To run a specific file, run
`npm run e2e <test file>`. If you want to see the browser while
the test runs, set `HEADLESS=false`, e.g. `HEADLESS=false npm run e2e <test file>`.

##### Running visual regression browser tests

Visual regression tests uses dockerized Chromium in order to produce consistent and reproducible
image snapshots. The docker image is stored in GitHub Container Registry, so you'll need to
[authenticate](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/managing-container-images-with-github-container-registry/pushing-and-pulling-docker-images#authenticating-to-github-container-registry) properly to be
able to pull the image. A summarized version of the steps to authenticate is listed below, for convenience:

- Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
  - Select `write:packages` and `read:packages` as the required scopes
  - Copy down the token
  - Enable SSO
- Save your token in an environment variable, like so `export CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN`
- Run `echo $CR_PAT | docker login https://docker.pkg.github.com -u USERNAME --password-stdin`. Make sure to update it with your GitHub
  username
- To verify that you can pull the image, do `docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/zendesk/dockerhub-images/alpine-chrome:latest`

To run the visual regression test suite, run `npm run e2e:visual-regressions`. To run a single visual regression
test, run you can do `npm run e2e:visual-regressions -- <file>`. Note that
the `HEADLESS` flag won't work in the visual regression test suite.

#### Faster e2e development

Restarting the whole e2e dev server each time you run a single test in development takes too long.

Instead of doing that, you can just run the `e2e:server` in a concurrent process and then run individual e2e tests against the running process.

```bash
npm run e2e:server
#wait for the server to start
HEADLESS=false npm run e2e ./e2e/spec/chat/launcher.test.js
```

#### Debugging tests

To debug tests, run the test in headless mode, and add in `await jestPuppeteer.debug()`
in the test code to pause the test.

#### Loading the widget

We can convert the following snippet:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.zESettings = {
    webWidget: {
      offset: { horizontal: '100px', vertical: '150px' }
    }
  }
</script>
<script id="ze-snippet" src="..widget_url"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  zE('webWidget', 'open')
</script>
```

to the equivalent for testing in puppeteer:

```js
import loadWidget from 'e2e/helpers/widget-page'

await loadWidget()
  .evaluateBeforeSnippetLoads(() => {
    window.zESettings = {
      webWidget: {
        offset: { horizontal: '100px', vertical: '150px' }
      }
    }
  })
  .evaluateAfterSnippetLoads(() => {
    zE('webWidget', 'open')
  })
  .load()
```
