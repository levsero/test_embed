# Engagement Framework

A 3rd party engagement framework that handles brining Zendesk outside of the agent view and onto 3rd party websites.

## Getting started

This assumes you already have node installed. Run the following commands inside this folder:

```bash
npm install -g gulp
npm install
```

To run the build type `gulp build` in this folder for it to kick off. This creates a dist folder with a main.js file in it.
