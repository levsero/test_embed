# Snowflake beacon

This beacon is responsible for a few things
* The snippet that a 3rd party will embed into their site
* The communication layer for beaconing data
* The main build for what it should load

## Getting started

This assumes you already have node installed. Run the following commands inside this folder:

```bash
npm install -g gulp
npm install
```

To run the build just type `gulp` in this folder for it to kick off. This creates a dist folder with a main.js file in it.
