## Changelog

### 22 February 2018

- Header color will now match the theme color. It was previously grey.
- Enhanced the [color setting](/embeddables/docs/widget/zesettings#color) api. Now allows customizing the color of specific Widget elements. 
- View original article button is now a clickable icon at top right of Widget article (previously at bottom of the article).
- Widget height is now fixed across most states. This is to allow more content to be visible, and to avoid frequent resizing as the user moves around the Widget in order to create a more fluid experience.

- Fixed an issue with tables in help center articles. Now allows horizontal scrolling.
