## Content Security Policy (CSP) support

### Recommended setup

The Web Widget supports websites that use a Content Security Policy (CSP) and follows Google's [strict CSP guidelines](https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html). We recommend following Google's policy for the best support and easiest setup with the Web Widget.

When following these guidelines, add the `nonce` attribute to the Web Widget snippet.

```html
<!-- Start of Zendesk Widget script -->
<script
  nonce="{random}"
  id="ze-snippet"
  src="https://static.zdassets.com/ekr/snippet.js?key=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
></script>
<!-- End of Zendesk Widget script -->
```

This `{random}` value must be a unique cryptographic number that is generated by the server each time the CSP is transmitted.

**Note**: This security policy works with the new version of the Zendesk Web Widget snippet. Please ensure that your snippet looks like the example above.

### Custom setup (using other CSP directives)

We cannot guarantee that the Web Widget won't violate a custom CSP that does not follow Google's [guidelines](https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html). However, if you add the following directives, it should prevent the Web Widget causing violations:

```
default-src 'self'
            https://static.zdassets.com
            https://ekr.zdassets.com
            https://{zendeskSubdomain}.zendesk.com
            https://*.zopim.com
            wss://{zendeskSubdomain}.zendesk.com
            wss://*.zopim.com;
style-src 'unsafe-inline';
img-src 'self'
        https://v2assets.zopim.io
        https://static.zdassets.com
        data:;
```

If you have custom directives specified such as `script-src` or `connect-src`, add the hosts specified in `default-src` above.
