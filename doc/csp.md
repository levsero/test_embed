## Content Security Policy (CSP) support

### Recommended setup

The Web Widget supports websites that use a Content Security Policy (CSP) and follows Google's [strict CSP guidelines](https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html). We recommend following Google's policy for the best support and easiest setup with the Web Widget.

When following these guidelines, add the `nonce` attribute to the Web Widget snippet.

```html
<!-- Start of Zendesk Widget script -->
<script nonce="{random}" id="ze-snippet" src="https://static.zdassets.com/ekr/snippet.js?key=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"> </script>
<!-- End of Zendesk Widget script -->
```

This `{random}` value must be a unique cryptographic number that is generated by the server each time the CSP is transmitted.

**Note**: This security policy works with the new version of the Zendesk Web Widget snippet. Please ensure that your snippet looks like the example above by following [these steps](https://developer.zendesk.com/embeddables/docs/widget/csp#using-the-new-snippet).

### Custom setup (using other CSP directives)

We cannot guarantee that the Web Widget won't violate a custom CSP that does not follow Google's [guidelines](https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html). However, if you add the following hosts to the `default-src` directive in your policy, it should prevent the Web Widget causing violations:

```
default-src 'self'
            https://static.zdassets.com
            https://ekr.zdassets.com
            https://{zendeskSubdomain}.zendesk.com
            wss://{zendeskSubdomain}.zendesk.com
```

If you have custom directives specified such as `script-src` or `connect-src`, add the hosts specified above.

### Additional setup with legacy Chat

Add the extra hosts listed below:

```
https://*.zopim.com
https://*.zopim.io
https://*.zopim.io
```

You must also relax your policy for inline scripts and CSS styles by specifying `'unsafe-inline'` in both the `script-src` and `style-src` directives. This is because the snippet and styles for chat are injected into the host page at runtime. An example header that uses a custom `script-src` directive would look like:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' https://static.zdassets.com https://ekr.zdassets.com https://{zendeskSubdomain}.zendesk.com wss://{zendeskSubdomain}.zendesk.com https://*.zopim.com wss://*.zopim.com  https://*.zopim.io 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'
```
