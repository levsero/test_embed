## Rules

- Notify [#team-taipan] before deploying or for help.
- Taipan is located in Melbourne (AEST). Try to avoid [off hour](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/australia/melbourne) deployments
- We don't have a strict schedule, but try to avoid deploying after 3PM our time.
- A Deploy Buddy is required for all deploys to production.
- Don't deploy if any [staging status] and [pod999 smoke tests] are red without an exemption.
- Any PRs deployed must meet the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/zendesk/embeddable_framework/blob/master/packages/framework/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Code Freeze

**Do not deploy** if any of the [staging status] and [pod999 smoke tests] are red. These must be green before anyone can deploy unless an exemption is approved. This must be approved the same way as a normal [production freeze]

**Do not deploy** if a change freeze is in place unless an exemption is approved for a critical bug fix. They usually occur during big holidays and near the quaterly investor calls. To check, please look at the [production freeze] schedule.

## Steps to deploy

Below outlines the steps you will take in order to get your changes from a PR to released to all customers in production.

The Embeddable Framework is deployed using Samson, all samson build stages can be seen here [Samson - Embeddable Framework], though each relevant build stage will be linked in each step where relevant.

### Step 1 - Merge to master

Before you merge:

- Make sure your PR meets the guidelines outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Your PR has two thumbs, at least one from a member of [#team-taipan]

Once you merge to master, these build stages in Samson will be automatically kicked off.

- [Build Staging]
- [Build Production]

The build stages are responsible for building the assets and uploading them S3.

Once the build stages have completed, Samson will automatically release your changes to all release groups in staging.

- [Release Staging - Canary (Tier 1)]
- [Release Staging - General Availability]
- [Release Staging - VIP (Tier 2)]

At this point in time, your changes will be available for all widgets for all accounts in staging.

A simple way to verify this is to visit a Help Center for an account with a widget and in the browser's console, log out

```js
zE.version
```

This version will be the shorted hash of the last commit you just merged to master.

Alternatively, visit this API that lists each version

[https://ekr-staging.zdassets.com/products/web_widget](https://ekr-staging.zdassets.com/products/web_widget)

### Step 2 - Release to Production Canary (Tier 1)

Before releasing to production canary, verify that the [staging status] and [pod999 smoke tests] are passing.

If passing, deploy your release with [Release Production - Canary (Tier1)].

From here, you should begin monitoring production to confirm your changes haven't had a negative impact. Do this after each release.

- [Datadog - Production](https://zendesk.datadoghq.com/dashboard/qdb-cmm-tg2/web-widget)
- [Rollbar](https://rollbar-eu.zendesk.com/Zendesk/Embeddable-Framework/)

Similar to staging, you can view this API to confirm what versions are currently deployed to the different release groups in production

[https://ekr.zdassets.com/products/web_widget](https://ekr.zdassets.com/products/web_widget)

### Step 3 - Release to Production General Availability

Before you deploy, verify that the [canary smoke tests] and [production smoke tests] are passing.

If all green, release via the Samson stage [Release Production - General Availability].

Don't forget to continuing monitoring via [Datadog](https://zendesk.datadoghq.com/dashboard/qdb-cmm-tg2/web-widget) and [Rollbar](https://rollbar-eu.zendesk.com/Zendesk/Embeddable-Framework/) for a short amount of time once released to catch any unexpected changes.

### Step 4 - Release to Production VIP (Tier 2)

Before you deploy, verify that the [production smoke tests] are passing.

In order to deploy to tier 2, your changes must have soaked in General Availability for a set amount of time based on how risky your change is

| Risk   | Soak time |
| :----- | :-------- |
| Low    | 3 hours   |
| Medium | 3 days    |
| High   | 5 days    |

Once soaked with no issues, release via the Samson stage [Release Production - VIP (Tier2)].

Don't forget to continuing monitoring via [Datadog](https://zendesk.datadoghq.com/dashboard/qdb-cmm-tg2/web-widget) and [Rollbar](https://rollbar-eu.zendesk.com/Zendesk/Embeddable-Framework/) for a short amount of time once released to catch any unexpected changes.

## Deployment Process

Pull Requests are merged into `master` branch after receiving two üëçs. At least one of these must come from a member of [#team-taipan].

Samson will automatically deploy new tags to `Build Staging` and `Build Production`.

### Build Stages

During this stage, all the necessary files for the widget are built and uploaded to an S3 bucket. They are built automatically on merge to master for both staging (`Build Staging`) and production (`Build Production`). The widget remains unchanged after the stage finishes.

This stage typically takes 10 to 15 minutes to run.

### Release Stages

This stage is responsible for updating the version of the widget being used in staging or production. Widget version is controlled by
[Embed Key Registry](https://github.com/zendesk/embed_key_registry) and the release stages will update the version of the widget in
EKR. This stage typically takes less than a minute to run.

Embeddable Framework uses a staged rollout mechanism, where the assets are deployed to buckets of customers in stages. There are
3 stages in the deploy pipeline: Tier 1, the general availability release, and Tier 2.

#### Staging

In staging, the release to the 3 stages occur simultaneously, and the release is triggered automatically after `Build Staging` finishes.

Once the deploy is finished it will trigger our [automatic tests](https://jenkins.zende.sk/job/Web%20Widget/job/Dependencies/) to run in staging.

#### Production

Production deploys are done in stages. All production stages require a buddy. Please ping someone from Taipan via Slack [#team-taipan] when Samson asks for a deploy buddy. Do not deploy during a [production freeze] unless an exemption has been granted.

These are the steps for deploying changes to production:

1. The first step is deploying to the canary group (`Release Production - Canary (Tier 1)`). Make sure that
   [staging status] and [pod999 smoke tests] have all run and are passing before doing a deployment.
   Once deployed, allow a soak time of at least 30 minutes in this stage and only proceed to the next stage if
   [canary smoke tests](https://jenkins-smoke.zende.sk/job/smoke_canary/view/Web%20Widget/) are all green.

2. The second step is the general availability release (`Release Production - General Availability`). This updates all customers who aren't in Tier 1 or Tier 2. Most
   customers will be in this stage. Soak time for this should be longer, depending on the risk of the deployment.

   | Risk   | Soak time |
   | :----- | :-------- |
   | Low    | 3 hours   |
   | Medium | 3 days    |
   | High   | 5 days    |

3. The final step is deploying the widget to the critical customer group (`Release Production - VIP (Tier 2)`).

To verify what versions are currently deployed to each stage you can view this [API](https://ekr.zdassets.com/products/web_widget).

| Property       | Group                |
| :------------- | :------------------- |
| versions.tier1 | Canary               |
| version        | General availability |
| versions.tier2 | VIP                  |

To see what version your Web Widget is using, in the browser console you can log out zE.version. This will be the shorter hash of the release your Web Widget is on.

### Release Previewer

The previewer is automatically pipelined to be run after the general availability release stage (`Release Staging - General Availability` and `Release Production - General Availability`).

### LiveChat Popout

The popout is a static HTML file that is used to display the live chat popout window. It's loaded by customers through a static URL
(e.g. https://static.zdassets.com/web_widget/latest/liveChat.html in production). It is deployed independently of the widget and as
such has its own stage.

## Recovery

If there is a problem with the deployed version you will need to rollback to the previous stable version via Samson. You can very quickly re-deploy a working older release to the corresponding `Release *` stage by following these steps.

Additionally, we have a [runbook](https://zendesk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/rb/Embeddable+Runbook) to help diagnose common problems.

### Steps to Rollback

#### Step 1

Identify the stages you wish to rollback by first checking the recent deploys of [VIP Tier 2](https://samson.zende.sk/projects/embeddable_framework/stages/release-production-vip-tier2) followed by [General Availability](https://samson.zende.sk/projects/embeddable_framework/stages/production-release) and [Canary](https://samson.zende.sk/projects/embeddable_framework/stages/release-production-canary-tier1).

#### Step 2

Make a note of the `v####` tag of the last stable version on the stage. This is usually one before the last deploy.

E.g.

```
7 days ago 	00:00:03 	Levi Serebryanski (with Wayne See) deployed v3677 to Release Production - General Availability 	Succeeded
```

#### Step 3

Deploy the last stable `v####` tag to the stage on the [Releases Page](https://samson.zende.sk/projects/embeddable_framework/releases).

_Note:_ There is no need to run `Build Production` if you just need to rollback to an older existing version.

#### Step 4

Repeat Step 2 for each stage identified in Step 1.

#### Step 5

If the problem is going to take some time to fix, please revert your PR so that it's not holding up other deploys.

Please notify [#team-taipan] if a rollback has occurred out of Melbourne hours.

## Verification

- Test your changes on a production account.
- Keep an eye on our [web widget](https://zendesk.datadoghq.com/dashboard/qdb-cmm-tg2/web-widget) and [upstream](https://zendesk.datadoghq.com/dashboard/yut-9gq-ru7/web-widget-upstream-dependencies) dashboards to make sure nothing is out of the ordinary. These dashboards shows anomaly data on metrics when they are below or above the regular thresholds. Note that it is normal to see occasional spikes in certain metrics that will appear as anomaly data, however, if any metrics are consistently abnormal it may be related to a recent deploy.
- Make sure our [Production Smoke tests](https://jenkins-smoke.zende.sk/job/smoke_production/view/Web%20Widget/) pass.
- Check [Rollbar](https://rollbar-eu.zendesk.com/Zendesk/Embeddable-Framework/) for any new errors.
