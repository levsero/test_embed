## Key Definitions

- **Store**: The store is an object that holds application state
- **Reducer**: Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
- **Actions**: Actions are payloads of information that are consumed by reducers via subscription to the action type.
- **Action creator**: Action creators are functions that create actions.
- **Selector**: Selectors are functions that take Redux state as an argument and return some data.
- **Middleware**: Middleware provides an extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.

## Structure

#### Old file structure

We use different modules for each Embed or feature and a base module for anything that is common between them.

#### New file structure

We store all Embed specific code inside it's folder and anything more general goes in the Web Widget folder.

## Reducers

#### Break state into multiple reducers

Each piece of state in the module should have it's own reducer so that we don't end up with a giant reducer that is difficult to manage. Some parts of state can be combined into a single reducer if they are tightly coupled.

#### Reducers should be fairly simple

Do not put much logic inside of reducers. Any complex logic should be handled inside actions or inside middleware.

A reducer should never need to know about the state of other reducers.

```js
const actionCreator = {
  return {
    type: REQUEST_SENT,
    payload: requestPayload
  }
};

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  const { type, payload } = action;

  switch (type) {
    case REQUEST_SENT:
      return payload ? true : false; // only simple logic inside the reducer
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

#### Reducers file name convention

Reducers don't need to have the module name prefixing their state. eg `helpCenter-articles` can just be `articles` as it is already stored within the Help Center context.

## Actions

#### Define actions in all uppercase

Actions exports should always be in all uppercase.
Actions defined in the action-types file should contain the module path.

```js
  export const SEARCH_REQUEST_SENT = 'widget/helpCenter/SEARCH_REQUEST_SENT'; // good

  export const searchRequestSent = 'widget/helpCenter/searchRequestSent'; // bad
  export const SEARCH_REQUEST_SENT = 'SEARCH_REQUEST_SENT'; // bad
```

#### Define actions in one place

Action names are stored in an `${module}-action-types.js` file in the root of their module that is imported into relevant files. They should never be hardcoded as strings inside actions or reducers.

#### Name actions based on the action performed and not the result of the action

Actions should be named according to the action that just happened, not the result of the action. For example: `BUTTON_CLICKED` instead of `UPDATE_SOME_STATE`. This means reducers are responding to intention of the action instead of having to follow the action name.

```js
export const VIEW_MORE_BUTTON_CLICKED = 'widget/helpCenter/VIEW_MORE_BUTTON_CLICKED' // good
export const UPDATE_VIEW_MORE = 'widget/helpCenter/UPDATE_VIEW_MORE' // bad
```

Note: There are some slight exceptions to this rule that were allowed on a case by case basis.

#### Name actions in past tense

For example `BUTTON_CLICKED` instead of `BUTTON_CLICK`.

#### Async requests should be named consistently

When sending an asynchronous request to a 3rd party we use the thunk middleware and generate three actions. One for the request and then for any possible responses, usually success or fail. For example they should be named `*_REQUEST_SENT`, `*_REQUEST_SUCCESS`, `*_REQUEST_FAILURE`.

```js
export function sendChatRating(rating = null) {
  return dispatch => {
    zChat.sendChatRating(comment, err => {
      if (!err) {
        dispatch({ type: CHAT_RATING_REQUEST_SUCCESS })
      } else {
        dispatch({ type: CHAT_RATING_REQUEST_FAILURE })
      }
    })
    dispatch({ type: CHAT_RATING_REQUEST_SENT })
  }
}
```

We can then update any loading state when the sent action comes though.

```js
const initialState = false

const loading = (state = initialState, action) => {
  const { type } = action

  switch (type) {
    case CHAT_RATING_REQUEST_SENT:
      return true
    case CHAT_RATING_REQUEST_SUCCESS:
    case CHAT_RATING_REQUEST_FAILURE:
      return false
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

## Action Creators

#### Always use an action creator to dispatch actions

Never dispatch actions from anywhere but an action creator, even if they're small actions. This ensures we have a centralized place for our actions.

```js
export const sendMsgRequest = () => {
  return {
    type: CHAT_MSG_REQUEST_SENT
  }
}
```

#### Name actions creators based on the action performed and not the result of the action

Like actions, action creators should be named according to the action that is happening, not what the outcome of the action will be.

#### Name actions creators in past tense

For example `handleButtonClicked` instead of `handleButtonClick`.

## Selectors

#### Always use selectors to access state

Never directly access certain parts of the application state with dot notation. Instead use selectors to access state, even if it’s extremely simple. This allows us to modify the state without having to change the props on the component.

```js
export const getZopimChatStatus = state => state.zopimChat.status
```

#### Use selectors for any logic concerning multiple states

The component shouldn’t handle any logic that involves multiple bits of state, this should be done inside a selector and passed into the component as a single prop.

```js
// good
const getHasContextuallySearched = (state) => state.helpCenter.hasContextuallySearched;
const getTotalUserSearches = (state) => state.helpCenter.totalUserSearches
export const getHasSearched = (state) => getHasContextuallySearched(state) || getTotalUserSearches(state) > 0;

class HelpCenter extends Component {
  renderSearchBar = () => {
    // Only needs one prop and logic is handled inside selector
    if (this.props.hasSearched) return null;
    ...
  }
}

// bad
export const getHasContextuallySearched = (state) => state.helpCenter.hasContextuallySearched;
export const getTotalUserSearches = (state) => state.helpCenter.totalUserSearches

class HelpCenter extends Component {
  renderSearchBar = () => {
    // Needs two props and component has extra logic
    if (this.props.hasContextuallySearched || this.props.totalUserSearches > 0) return null;
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Use reselect for memoization of state

For complex state that rerenders often we should memoize it using reselect. The react dom rerenders everytime a new input is entered, therefore any complex transformations of data should be memoized to minimize the impact of this.

```js
export const getChatMessages = createSelector(
  [getChats], // If the value of getChats
  chats => {
    const filterChatType = event => _.includes(['chat.msg', 'chat.file'], event.type)

    return _.filter([...chats.values()], filterChatType)
  }
)
```

#### Composing selectors

When we need state from multiple modules we should import and combine the selectors from each module into a common selector in the root folder. This ensures we have a common place for all this kind of state.

```js
import { getZopimChatOnline } from './zopimChat/zopimChat-selectors'
import { getSettingsChatSuppress } from './settings/settings-selectors'

export const getChatEnabled = state => getZopimChatOnline(state) && !getSettingsChatSuppress(state)
```

#### Use selectors everywhere

Selectors should be imported wherever needed, not just inside components. They can also be used in actions, middleware and more.

#### Don't define any default state inside selectors

Don't set up selectors to return default state, we should be relying on the initial state of reducers for this.

```js
// Good: With initial state set up in reducers
export const getChatEnabled = (state) => state.chat.enabled

// Bad: Might not reflect what the store actually has stored
export const getChatEnabled = (state) => _.get(state, 'chat.enabled', true);
```

## Middleware

#### Thunk middleware

Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. Inside this function you can delay dispatching actions and dispatch multiple actions in the one action creator. This is used for asynchronous requests as we can dispatch actions when a request is started as well as when it's completed.

```js
export function sendChatRating(rating = null) {
  return dispatch => {
    zChat.sendChatRating(comment, err => {
      if (!err) {
        dispatch({ type: CHAT_RATING_REQUEST_SUCCESS })
      } else {
        dispatch({ type: CHAT_RATING_REQUEST_FAILURE })
      }
    })
    dispatch({ type: CHAT_RATING_REQUEST_SENT })
  }
}
```

#### onStateChange middleware

onStateChange middleware allows us to react to changes in state outside of the reducers. This is useful because we can get state changes from 3rd parties (chat and talk) and we don't want to have to handle any changes we need to make based on these state changes inside components.

```js
const onChatConnected = (prevState, nextState, dispatch) => {
  if (getConnection(prevState) === 'connecting' && getConnection(nextState) !== 'connecting') {
    dispatch(accountSettingsUpdate())
  }
}

export default function onStateChange(prevState, nextState, _, dispatch) {
  onChatConnected(prevState, nextState, dispatch)
}
```

#### Other Middleware uses

Middleware can also be used to handle tangentially related application logic that doesn't belong in components or reducers but relies on knowing about state or action updates.
For example we have a blip middleware that handles sending blips when actions are performed so they don't need to be handled inside components or reducers to keep them as simple as possible.
